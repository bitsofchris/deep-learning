Project Outline: Heart Rate Intelligence
Phase 1: Data Preparation & Initial Exploration

Extract WHOOP data: Export your heart rate data (likely CSV format with timestamps and HR values)
Data cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, ensure consistent sampling rate
Basic visualization: Plot raw HR data at different time scales (hourly, daily, weekly)
Compute basic statistics: Resting HR, max HR, variability metrics

Phase 2: Fourier Transform Analysis
Multi-scale Pattern Discovery:

Circadian rhythms: Use FFT to identify 24-hour cycles in your HR
Weekly patterns: Look for 7-day cycles (work vs weekend differences)
Ultradian rhythms: Identify shorter cycles (90-120 min cycles, meal responses)
Exercise patterns: Detect regular workout times/frequencies

Practical applications:

Spectrograms: Create time-frequency plots to see how your HR patterns change over weeks/months
Power spectral density: Identify dominant frequencies in your lifestyle
Filtering: Use Fourier to denoise data or isolate specific frequency bands

Phase 3: Time Series Forecasting
Model Selection from Hugging Face:

Consider models like:

Chronos: Amazon's foundation model for time series
TimeGPT: If available open-source
Lag-Llama: Probabilistic forecasting model
PatchTST: Good for long-term dependencies



Forecasting experiments:

Short-term: Predict next hour's HR pattern
Daily: Forecast tomorrow's HR profile
Anomaly detection: Flag unusual patterns

Phase 4: Fourier-Enhanced Forecasting
Data quality improvements:

Denoising: Use FFT to remove high-frequency noise before forecasting
Feature engineering: Extract frequency-domain features as additional inputs
Seasonal decomposition: Separate trend, seasonal, and residual components
Missing data imputation: Use frequency domain interpolation

Phase 5: Augmented Intelligence Insights
Personal discoveries you might uncover:

Sleep quality indicators:

HR variability patterns during sleep stages
Recovery quality based on overnight HR trends


Stress patterns:

Identify times/days with elevated baseline HR
Correlation with work schedule or life events


Fitness insights:

Recovery time after workouts
Training adaptation (decreasing resting HR over time)
Optimal workout timing based on HR readiness


Lifestyle patterns:

Caffeine/alcohol effects on HR
Meal timing impacts
Seasonal variations


Health alerts:

Early warning signs of overtraining
Potential illness detection (elevated resting HR)
Irregular heart rhythm detection
