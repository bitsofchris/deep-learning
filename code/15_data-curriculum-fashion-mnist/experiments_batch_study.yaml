# Batch Size vs Curriculum Learning Interaction Study
# Tests whether curriculum learning effectiveness depends on batch size
# Explores batch sizes from 4 to 128 with random vs curriculum ordering

experiments:
  # Random Baseline across different batch sizes
  - ordering_method: "random"
    runs: 1                          # Single run for quick exploration
    num_epochs: [10]                 # Training epochs
    batch_sizes: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]  # 6 different batch sizes
    learning_rates: [0.005]          # Fixed learning rate
    
  # Curriculum Learning across different batch sizes  
  - ordering_method: "curriculum"
    runs: 1                          # Single run for quick exploration
    num_epochs: [10]                 # Training epochs
    batch_sizes: [4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128]  # Same 6 batch sizes
    learning_rates: [0.005]          # Fixed learning rate
    strategies: ["medoid_first", "quartiles_only", "inverse", "round_robin"]  # All 4 curriculum strategies
    n_clusters: [50]                 # Number of clusters for analysis
    use_pca: [true]                  # Apply PCA before clustering
    pca_components: [50]             # PCA dimensions

# This creates 30 total experiments:
# - 6 random baseline experiments (one per batch size)  
# - 24 curriculum experiments (4 strategies × 6 batch sizes)

# Research Questions:
# 1. Does curriculum learning work better with smaller batch sizes?
# 2. Is the curriculum "failure" at batch size 32 representative?
# 3. What's the optimal batch size for Fashion-MNIST training?
# 4. How does batch size affect the curriculum vs random performance gap?

# Expected Results by Strategy:
# - medoid_first (Easy→Hard): Traditional curriculum learning
# - quartiles_only (Easy→Hard, no separate medoids): Similar to medoid_first
# - inverse (Hard→Easy): Anti-curriculum approach  
# - round_robin (Max Diversity): Batch variety maximization
#
# Expected Batch Size Effects:
# - Small batches (4, 8, 16): Strong curriculum signal, best chance for structured > random
# - Medium batches (32): Your current results (structured ≈ random or worse)  
# - Large batches (64, 128): Weak curriculum signal, structured ≈ random
# 
# Key Metrics: 
# - Best strategy per batch size
# - Curriculum effectiveness = (Strategy Accuracy - Random Accuracy) per batch size
# - Optimal batch size identification
