# Complete Curriculum Learning Study: 4 Data Ordering Strategies
# Compares random, easy→hard, hard→easy, and maximum diversity approaches

experiments:
  # 1. Random Baseline (Control Group)
  - ordering_method: "random"
    runs: 1                    # Multiple runs for statistical significance
    num_epochs: [10]           # Training epochs
    batch_sizes: [32]          # Batch size
    learning_rates: [0.005]    # Learning rate
    
  # 2. Easy → Hard Curriculum (Traditional Curriculum Learning)
  - ordering_method: "curriculum"
    runs: 1
    num_epochs: [10]
    batch_sizes: [32]
    learning_rates: [0.005]
    strategies: ["medoid_first"]  # Medoids → Q1 → Q2 → Q3 → Q4
    n_clusters: [50]              # Number of clusters for analysis
    use_pca: [true]               # Apply PCA before clustering
    pca_components: [50]          # PCA dimensions
    
  # 3. Hard → Easy Curriculum (Anti-Curriculum Learning)
  - ordering_method: "curriculum"
    runs: 1
    num_epochs: [10]
    batch_sizes: [32]
    learning_rates: [0.005]
    strategies: ["inverse"]       # Q4 → Q3 → Q2 → Q1 → Medoids
    n_clusters: [50]
    use_pca: [true]
    pca_components: [50]
    
  # 4. Maximum Diversity (Round-Robin Cluster Sampling)
  - ordering_method: "curriculum"
    runs: 1
    num_epochs: [10]
    batch_sizes: [32] 
    learning_rates: [0.005]
    strategies: ["round_robin"]   # Round-robin sampling from all clusters
    n_clusters: [50]
    use_pca: [true]
    pca_components: [50]

# Research Questions:
# 1. Does curriculum learning (easy→hard) help Fashion-MNIST classification?
# 2. Does anti-curriculum (hard→easy) perform differently than curriculum?
# 3. Does maximizing batch diversity outperform difficulty-based ordering?
# 4. Which data ordering strategy achieves the best final accuracy?
#
# Expected Outcomes:
# - If curriculum helps: Easy→Hard > Random > Hard→Easy
# - If diversity helps: Max Diversity > Random > Easy→Hard ≈ Hard→Easy  
# - If curriculum hurts: Random ≈ Max Diversity > Easy→Hard ≈ Hard→Easy
