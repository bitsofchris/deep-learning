# Intraday Stock Price Classification

Project Goal:
Develop a neural network model to predict intraday stock price movements (up or down) based on recent price and volume data.

Data:
Use hourly stock data from yfinance.

Feature Engineering:
Create relative features from price and volume data.
Maybe explore concepts in feature engineering and validating or scoring features.

Model Architecture:
Start with a simple feedforward neural network.
In future iterations, can try LSTM.

Task:
Binary classification: predict whether the stock price will move up or down in the next hour (ie. the next time step).


### Next Steps / Future Ideas

##### More Data and Feature Engineering
For a problem like this I think it's either better features or more data or both that will make the difference.

##### More Advanced architecture
I don't know enough yet to understand what I don't know. This was just a basic neural network, similar to the hello world image classification network.

There are a whole bunch of techniques and different model architectures I don't know about yet.
