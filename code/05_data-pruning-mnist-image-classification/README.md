# Data Pruning - MNIST Image Classification

# Goal
How far can we reduce the size of MNIST dataset and still get "good" performance?

Let's say good is 95% accuracy or better.


# Set Up

The baseline model will be LeNet-5.

Train on the full 60,000 MNIST training images, test on the standard 10,000 images.

Final test accuracy expected ~98â€“99%.

# Results
Baseline, full dataset: 99%

Pruning
Keep Random 50%: 98.93%
Keep Random 10%: 97.20%
Keep Random 1% : 90.69%
