# 30-Day Time Series AI Challenge: Day 0 - Introduction

## Why I'm Doing This Challenge

I'm a former day trader turned data engineer now a Staff Research Engineer on a Time Series AI Research team building foundation models for time series.

This challenge is a chance to go deeper into core concepts of Time Series AI.

## Challenge Overview

Over the next 30 business days (weekdays only), I'll be following my curiosity to explore different aspects of time series AI.

Each day I'll write a text post, occasionally with code or visualizations.

Weekends I'm off - its necessary to sustain these types of challenges IMO.

Everything will end up on my substack https://bitsofchris.com/s/time-series-ai with weekly YouTube recaps.
