Supervised Learning - how we trained and predict text with LLMs

It's good at some classical AI tasks like sentiment or spam analysis - faster and cheaper.

Can make up things though.

General purpose tool.
Writing, reading, chatting three tasks of LLM

More context , more specific the response.
Ie, translate into formal spoke X

Reading tasks
Proofreading. Tell it what text is for than to correct spelling and grammatical errors.
Summarize. Papers and meeting transcripts. Getting zoom transcripts? For meetings to summarize for execs?
Email or post analysis. Classification, reputation monitoring.

What LLMs can and can’t do
Can a brand new college grad do what you are about to ask? It has lots of general knowledge but it has nothing specific about you (can’t read your mind).
Hallucinations - Shakespeare quotes on Beyoncé.

What is optimal prompt length per model?
 Context length is limit on input and output size

LLMs don’t work well with tabular data. Use supervised learning.

Gen Ai works best with instructed data like text images audio video.

Tips for prompting
be detailed and specific - give it sufficient context and background.
Guide the model to think through the answer, like multiple steps to follow in a process.
Experiment and iterate- use a process not a canned prompt. Evaluate prompt and iterate.
Process.


Lifecycle of a gen ai project 

Number of tokens roughly 33% more than number of words.

Retrieval augmented generation
Chat with your pdf tools.
Use your documents, look for relevant ones, inject it into the prompt to answer question.

LLM as a reasoning engine.
Relevant context provided, it processes the text to get an answe. It’s a way to process information rather than a source of info.

Fine Tuning
For when it’s hard to define in a prompt.
Take a pre trained model then fine tune it with your data to shift its tendency. 
Good for a certain style but might have to make your own dataset.
Mimic a certain writing or speaking style.
Fine tune to help LLm gain specific knowledge.
Getting a smaller model to perform a task.

Pre training
only done by large companies basically, expensive

Choosing LLM
Model size
1B pattern matching 
10B basic instructions
100B complex reasoning 

RLHF - helpful, honest, harmless
Humans score model responses 

Following instructions 
Instruction tuning, train it in good examples of answers.

Agents
LLM choose and carry out complex actions
By calling tools in a sequence of actions

Tools for reasoning, not great at math. Like it could then call a tool from LLM to make it better like calling a calculator.

### Gen Ai in business and society 
LLMs used as writing assistants.

Thought partner.

Task analysis for using AI.
Ai automated tasks not jobs but jobs involve a collection of many tasks.
Look at what tasks in a process can be automated- this is key.

Augmented vs automated
Help humans or have ai be autonomous 
Generally starts with augmentation then automation.

Ai potential for value
- can Ai technically do the task - try prompting, can college grad do it, can rag or fine tuning do it 
- What’s the business value for using ai on this task - how much time is spent on this? Is this task faster or cheaper more valuable?
Often not the iconic task of a job is the easiest automated.

Break down jobs into tasks and think about what tasks can be automated or augmented.

New workflows and opportunities with AI
Reviewing, researching, maybe faster.
Writing/ drafting. Can a/b test perhaps because can do a quicker iteration cycle here

More than just cost savings by changing the workflow instead of just doing things quicker.

Analyze a customers task For gen ai potential.
Then you can maybe solve a new problem for customers.

My key idea:
If you don’t have to do this task anymore - what’s the new thing you could do with your time to add value to the people or customers you serve?

ML engineers should learn LLMs, prompting, RAG, fine-tuning.

Prompt engineer is not a role, it was a media hype.

Ai and society
RLHF to reduce bias.
Humans scoring response and then supervised learning on the score.

Job loss concerns
You do a lot more tasks in most roles than what can be automated or augmented. *look for what other value you can add with the time freed up*

Every wave of tech creates new jobs because of business incentives to grow. Not just cut costs. If the only goal was cost cutting we’d lose jobs. 

Human extinction mos arguments just say it could happen. Humanity has lots of experience controlling many things.




AGI
Can do any intellectual task a human can.
Like drive a car in 20 hours or get PHD in 5 years.

Ai and bio intelligence are different paths
There are things computers do better already- it’s just more. Learn to embrace these differences (my note - go deeper on these differences )

Ai
Lowers the cost of intelleifnexe
you Can get an army of interns for cheap now
Not restricted only to wealthy companies to hire intelligence.

Fear of electricity as analogy to fear of ai 
(Maybe find an article on that )
