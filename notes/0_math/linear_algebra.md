Vectors 
Ordered list of numbers (cs) student
(2 dimensional vector = list of two)

Vector - think of arrow in x-y plane with tail on origin.
Bracket notation indicates vector, parenthesis coordinate points.
2d vector- first number is x step, second is y.

Vector addition
Tail of second vector on head of first one. Vector from origin or original tail to new head is the sum.

Vector multuplication
Scales a vector.


Think of vector values as a scalar on the basis vectors: i hat (x) and j hat (y)
X coordinate scales i 
Y coordinate scales j 

The span 
It’s the set of all possible vectors you can reach with a linear combination of two vectors 
When dealing with an individual vector think of it as an arrow.
A set of vectors think of it as a set of points

Vectors that line up, their span is a line.

The span of 2, 2d vectors in 3d space is a flat sheet. Infinites in the 2d plan but can’t move from that.

Matrices as linear transformations*
Transformation== function 
Vector as input spits out vector as output
Think movement from all input vectors to output vectors.
Linear- origin is fixed and lines remain lines no curving.

Need to track the basis vectors 
Just need coordinations of I hat and j hat
2x2 matrix * 2x1 vector

Shear
One basis vector fixed

Confused why matrix points in first column are not x and y when multiplying by vector- because they represent the x basis vector?



Matrix is a transformation
2x2 describes the change of I hat and j hat
