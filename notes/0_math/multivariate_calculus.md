Derivative - how much change in input changes the output of a single variate function

Partial derivative - different notation, how much an input changes output of a multi variate function. Partial because doing it for one variable only tells part of the change to the function

To get the partial derivative you just pretend there are constant values in the other variables and then take the derivative like normal. Basically holding everything fixed, seeing how changing one variable changes the output
