### AI
Aritificial narrow intillegence - a lot of stuff today
Gen Ai - like LLMs making thigns

### Machine learning
supervised learning - inputs wiht labeled outputs.
LLM - trained in input words and then an output work - so ever growing list of inputs to predict the next word.

Learning from a lot of data.
Supervised input -> output mapping you train a model

##### Why now
traditional AI performance leveled out at a certain point with more data
larger neural networks get better for more training data, still seems the larger we make a neural network the better they get

### What is Data
labeled -> by huamn?
observabed -> in the data has a like a sold/not sold field or some output filed
can be messy, mislabeled, unstructured (audio, text, images)

### Terminology
- Machine learning - given a prdecit B, the model, the input to output training
- data science - extarcting insihgts from data, so output usually a prsentation
- deep learning- neural network -> bunch of paraemters (a) into ANN -> output b
	- the ANN is a big math equation
- AI
	- ML
		- DL/NN
		- other tools
	- other AI tools
- DS cuts across AI and uses other tools

### AI Transformation
- pilot projects
- in-house ai team
- broad ai training
- develop ai strategy
- align internal and external comms


### What AI can and cant do
- 1 second of thought -> can probably automate
- "simple" concepts
- lots of data available

### Deep Learning Explained
- neurons - a lot of them combined
- each neuron can combine input parameters in different ways
- and then each neuron can map as input into another neuron that takes the dreived output of a neuron as inputs 
- the network figures out the weights of neurons as you feed it lots of input A data and output B data

### Other Techniques
unsupervised learning - liek clustering - not needing labelled data but not very effective right now like a kid can see 5 coffee mugs and know

reinforcement leaerning

GANs - generative advesarial networks
