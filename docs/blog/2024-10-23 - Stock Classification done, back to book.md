# 2024-10-23 - Stock Classifier Working
I fixed a few minor things and managed to get this very naive network working on my 20k sample dataset. It's able to predict the next direction correctly ~53% of the time which probably means it didn't really learn anything (given the bull market we've been in I'm sure 53% is about what you get if you just predict every next bar is up).

That being said - it's still a learning victory for me, in 2-3 mornings I was able to clean and feature-engineer a dataset, adapt my image classification network to a new problem, and have an end-to-end network running. It's also a super difficult domain problem but still, a fun one to get running from scratch.

I'm sure I'll revisit problems like these in the future.

### Feature Engineering Factory
I don't have this but in my opinion, for a problem like trading with ML, this is what you need. As an individual, you won't compete on data and compute, but you can compete on creativity and specificity. Finding a small niche in some arbitrary corner of the market that doesn't require massive compute but rather just some exploration seems the most plausible path to success (if there is one for an amateur deep learning trader).

If/ when I revisit this problem, I think the key will be improving velocity for engineering features. This means having a clean dataset and being able to quickly iterate and validate on features to see what offers predictive power or not.

### Back to the book
This was a nice break away from theory and structured learning, but time to get back to the book. I'd like to finish this one before starting the LLM book. 

I've also had another trading idea for crypto I've been curious to analyze since there is no good data on this particular problem - I think building the dataset alone could be an edge but it would distract from my learning here.  Maybe as a break or a reward for finishing this neural network book.
