# 2024-11-05 - Finished reading the book!

Celebrating this milestone today. That was 5 or 6 weeks? I still need to implement a CNN in PyTorch but I've read the entire book.

Today's reading was great - really interesting getting a 10 year old perspective on a field that's exploded today thanks to recent advances. Also was a great survey of things to come in my learning journey - recurrent neural nets and LSTMs have been on my list to get to as well. 

I'm also curious now as to why deep belief nets fell out of favor or if any progress has been made. Michael ends the book discussing Conway's law and how the field of deep learning hasn't yet specialized into the many sub-fields. But rather most papers were using similar methods.

I'm not sure where we are exactly today but it seems a lot of the techniques are variations on the fundamentals in this book (which is why I chose to start here).

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement the PyTorch convolutional neural network using the architecture and methods in the book.
- [ ] Do some data augmentation
- [ ] read the books' appendix
