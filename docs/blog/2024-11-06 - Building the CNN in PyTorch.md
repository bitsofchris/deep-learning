# 2024-11-06 - Building the CNN in PyTorch

Spent a lot of time back in the book, felt a little lost getting back into writing some PyTorch code here but it's a good muscle to exercise.

Pulled in some code from my previous PyTorch network which made it easy to start, then I let co-pilot just generate some starter CNN code. I have to follow up here tomorrow with the documentation open to map the parameters here to the architecture we want (and to understand it better).

It felt like a big jump but I will work through a few PyTorch examples I found to implement this CNN now. I also want to go slow here and add comments like I did the other networks so I can have notes in my code as I implement this and really learn it.

Related, I forgot I just used the PyTorch loader to get the data - so that was nice to just add back as well.

### Next Steps
- [ ] implementing the CNN - use PyTorch docs + examples to implement the CNN as prescribed from the book
