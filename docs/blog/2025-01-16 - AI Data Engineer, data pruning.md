# 2025-01-16 - Pivot into Data Pruning, AI Data Engineering
It's been a while, but I've been busy doing related work.

I'm putting LLMs from scratch down for now to work on more relevant things to related to my role at my day job as the data engineer for an AI Research department - what I've been calling an AI Data Engineer.

I started to align my morning learning, projects, and content creation with this focus. 

And it feels phenomenal.

Limiting my scope, focusing more intently and taking a project driven approach is fun, more impactful, and more sustainable.

### Data Pruning
I've had this in mind for a while after reading a few papers on the topic.

How much data do we really need?

Happy to have started this today. And to my surprise randomly removing 50% of the MNIST still gave a 98.93% accuracy! With my baseline being 99.0%.

Expect more experiments here and a writeup, I'm testing out a k-means clustering approach too.
