# 2024-10-18 - PyTorch Getting Started
I've been using Ray Core at work recently so I don't feel the need to parallelize my neural network from scratch. Instead I started with [PyTorch's quickstart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html)and tried to apply that to the MNIST data for digit recognition.

I went through the quickstart pretty fast, but having done the "hard" work of understanding what a neural network needs it was pretty easy to follow the PyTorch syntax.

I also just used PyTorch's DataSet class to load the MNIST data to make life easier.

I'm starting to lose a tiny bit of motivation on this problem and feel like maybe I am going a little too slow at the moment. 

### Next Steps
- [ ] Do the full PyTorch getting start tutorial? - I think this is a good idea, I need to get a deeper understanding of PyTorch for work as well, seems like a good fit.
- [ ] Finish the neural network book - I'd really like to finish this book before moving on to the LLM book to learn about Transformers
