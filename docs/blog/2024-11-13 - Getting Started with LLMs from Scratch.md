# 2024-11-13 - Getting Started with LLMs from Scratch

I decided to hold off on a data pruning project and get to the book LLMs from Scratch. I've had this for over a month, patiently waiting until I finished the foundations of neural networks.

Today was a bit more house keeping then coding or learning for me. Updated some docs, moved some notes around, and got setup to begin this book.

I'll code any examples and exercises that seem useful or interesting. And like last time, if all I do is read and take notes then I'll use the daily blog note to recap what I just learned in my own words and if my time allows have AI correct me.
