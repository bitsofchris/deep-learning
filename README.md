# My Public Second Brain

This repo is a collection of resources, notes, and code as I learn in public.

I am former day trader turned data engineer learning how to build my own Transformer models on time series data.

Like Richard Feynman believed - if you can't explain it simply or create it from scratch, you don't really know it.

If you'd like to learn more about me or follow my work head to [bitsofchris.com](https://bitsofchris.com).
